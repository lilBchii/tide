# How to Contribute
Thank you for considering contributing to Tide! To figure out the current state
of the library, check the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/lilBchii/tide/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

Tide began as a student project, but it aims to grow, and all contributors are welcome.
Actually, we would appreciate contribution on every aspect of the project. Wether it is
about performance improvement, architecture design, UI/UX enhancement or issue fixing,
feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

Also, if you think about a feature you would like to see in Tide but you are not familiar
with Rust or you don't have enough time to write code, you can open an issue.
##
Please consider formatting the code before committing thanks to the `rustfmt.toml`.
